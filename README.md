Minha Despensa (My Pantry) is a prototype made during a [Hackaton at SAP Labs](https://saptechniversity2016.splashthat.com/) in SÃ£o Leopoldo - Brazil.

We had a couple of hours to propose a solution to a real customer, a large supermarket group, to help reduce their customers food waste.

Our proposal was an website that would keep track of when something was purchased (since currently there's no way to obtain the product expiration date from the invoice), read the list of products, dates of purchase and quantities, and suggest to the user to consume products that were purchased longer ago, also based on how many days that product is considered to be fresh. The site also recommends recipts using those products that might be approaching the expiration date.

Take a look at the prototype of [Minha Despensa](https://rafaeleyng.github.io/minha-despensa/front/).
